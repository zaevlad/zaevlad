### 🧠 Who am I?

I’m an AI-assisted Web3 Security Engineer focused on:
- AI-driven vulnerability analysis
- Pattern-based exploit detection
- Smart contract security automation
- Building security systems, not just reports

I operate at the intersection of:
> **Blockchain Security × AI Engineering × Research Systems**

---

### 🔥 What I Do

- 🤖 **AI-powered security systems** — building tools that audit smarter, not harder
- 🧠 **Vulnerability intelligence** — pattern extraction, exploit taxonomy, detection heuristics
- 🔬 **Smart contract research** — deep protocol analysis, adversarial thinking, edge case hunting
- ⚡ **AI-assisted engineering** — shipping security infra at 3x speed with vibe coding
- 🏗️ **Builder-first mindset** — products > papers, systems > reports

---

### 🔥 Core Focus

- 🤖 AI-powered audit tooling & automation
- 🔬 Smart contract vulnerability research
- 🧠 Pattern mining & exploit intelligence
- ⚔️ Adversarial analysis mindset
- 🚀 Builder-first, research-second, founder-thinking

### 🏴 Research Focus

**Core thesis:** Security tooling needs to evolve from static checkers to intelligent, context-aware systems.

- 🤖 **AI-native vulnerability detection** — moving beyond regex to semantic understanding
- 🧠 **LLM-assisted auditing** — augmenting human auditors with AI reasoning
- 📊 **Exploit intelligence systems** — building taxonomies that learn and adapt
- 🔬 **Hybrid detection architectures** — combining static analysis, symbolic execution, and LLMs
- ⚙️ **Security automation infra** — designing scalable, production-grade detection pipelines

---

### 🏆 Experience

- 🧠 Audit competitions:
  - [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/@zaevlad)
  - [CodeHawks](https://profiles.cyfrin.io/u/vladzaev)

- 🛠 Hands-on:
  - Smart contract security analysis & exploit development
  - AI infrastructure for security tooling
  - Building production-grade detection systems

---

### ⚡ Vibe Coding Workflow

I leverage AI-assisted development to build security infrastructure at unprecedented speed:

- 🚀 **Rapid prototyping** — turning exploit theories into POCs in hours, not days
- 🔄 **Intelligent automation** — AI writes boilerplate, I architect the core logic
- 🧪 **Fast iteration cycles** — test, break, rebuild with AI pair programming
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure at scale** — building complex detection pipelines 3x faster

**Tools:** Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, custom LLM prompts, agentic workflows

> **Philosophy:** AI doesn't replace engineering — it amplifies it. I use it to focus on high-leverage problems while automating the rest.
